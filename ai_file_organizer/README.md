# 🚀 AI File Organizer: Smart Data Orchestration Engine

> **"A production-grade, AI-powered system designed to transform digital chaos into structured intelligence."**

Developed by **Syed Shaheer Hussain** | 2026 ©  
*Streamlining file management with the power of Rust, Machine Learning, and Deterministic Rules.*

---

## 🌟 Introduction

The **AI File Organizer** is a high-performance, cross-platform utility engineered to solve the "Digital Hoarding" crisis. Built with the memory safety and speed of **Rust**, this tool goes beyond simple extension sorting. It employs a **hybrid classification strategy**—combining deterministic JSON rules with OpenAI's Large Language Models (LLM) and local ONNX runtimes—to understand the *context* of your files.

Whether you're a photographer with thousands of RAW files, a developer with scattered repositories, or a professional managing finance documents, this engine automates the sorting, renaming, and deduplication process with surgical precision.

## 💎 Core Features

1.  **Parallel Hashing**: Uses `Rayon` to hash large file sets in parallel, making duplicate detection near-instant.
2.  **Deterministic Rules**: Regex-based sorting for invoices, screenshots, and specific work files.
3.  **LLM Classification**: Sends file context to OpenAI to categorize files rules can't catch (e.g., "Personal Notes" vs "Code snippets").
4.  **Hardware-Accelerated GUI**: A dark-mode desktop app for those who prefer drag-and-drop over the terminal.
5.  **Infinite Undo**: Every "Organize" run creates a `.undo_history.json` snapshot. Revert any mistake instantly.
6.  **Real-time Watcher**: Monitor your Downloads folder; as soon as a file hits the folder, it is moved to its permanent home.
7.  **Deep Metadata Inspection**: Reads EXIF dates from photos and PDF metadata for smarter grouping.

## ⌨️ Command Reference

### 1. Installation
```powershell
# Prerequisites: Install Rust (rustup.rs)
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/syedshaheer/ai_file_organizer
cd ai_file_organizer
cargo build --release
```

### 2. Scanning (The Discovery Phase)
Lists files and calculates potential savings.
```powershell
cargo run -- scan ./Downloads
```

### 3. Organizing (The Action Phase)
The heavy lifter. Moves files into categories.
```powershell
# Standard rule-based organization
cargo run -- organize C:\Users\User\Downloads

# AI-powered organization (Requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
# $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key"
cargo run -- organize ./folder --ai

# Dry run (Safety check)
cargo run -- organize ./folder --dry-run
```

### 4. Deduplication
Find and eliminate redundant data.
```powershell
# Just list duplicates
cargo run -- duplicates ./MyPhotos

# Auto-remove duplicates (keeping newest)
cargo run -- duplicates ./MyPhotos --remove
```

### 5. Undo (The Safety Net)
```powershell
cargo run -- undo ./folder
```

### 6. Real-time Monitoring
```powershell
cargo run -- watch ./Downloads
```

### 7. Graphical Interface
```powershell
cargo run -- gui
```

## 🧠 The "Syed Shaheer" Implementation Story

### How I Learned & Realized This Project
I saw my "Downloads" folder becoming a graveyard of PDFs, screenshots, and zip files. Manual sorting was a 2-hour chore. I realized that **Rules** handle 80% of files, but **AI** is needed for the other 20% where naming is ambiguous. I chose **Rust** because handling thousands of I/O operations and high-speed hashing requires a language that doesn't have a Garbage Collector pause.

### What, When, Where, How, Why?
*   **What:** A hybrid deterministic/AI file manager.
*   **When:** Created in February 2026 to solve modern digital clutter.
*   **Where:** Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
*   **How:** Built using `Tokio` for async and `egui` for the frontend.
*   **Why:** Because your time is better spent creating, not moving files.

## ⚠️ Cautions & Disclaimer

*   **Warning:** AI Mode sends file *names* and *metadata* to OpenAI. Do not use AI mode on folders containing sensitive/classified filename data if you do not want it sent to an external API.
*   **Caution:** Duplicate removal is permanent (unless you use a Recycle Bin wrapper). Always perform a `--dry-run` first.
*   **Disclaimer:** This software is provided "as is". While we have implemented an Undo system, I recommend backing up mission-critical data before massive organization operations.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- [ ] **OCR Integration**: Read text *inside* images to categorize them.
- [ ] **Cloud Connectors**: Organize files directly in Google Drive/Dropbox.
- [ ] **Perceptual Hashing**: Detect "similar" images, not just identical ones.
- [ ] **Mobile Port**: A companion app for Android/iOS.

## 📝 Important Notes

*   **Custom Rules**: Edit `config/default_rules.json` to add your own regex.
*   **Performance**: For folders with >100k files, use the CLI for maximum speed.
*   **Privacy**: Rule-based mode is 100% offline.
